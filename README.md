Warehouse Logistics & Order Fulfillment System

📦 Project Overview

The **Warehouse Logistics & Order Fulfillment System** is a C++ application built using the **Win32 GUI** that simulates real-world warehouse operations. The system manages categories, items, inventory stock, and customer orders while demonstrating the practical use of fundamental data structures.

This project was developed from scratch by a **team of four** as an academic and learning-focused implementation of warehouse logistics.


🚀 Features

* Create and manage warehouse categories
* Add, update, and track items with stock quantities
* Enqueue and process customer orders
* Automatically decrement stock during order fulfillment
* Display warehouse data (categories, items, orders, and actions)
* Undo functionality to revert previous operations



 🛠️ Technologies & Data Structures Used

* **Language:** C++
* **GUI:** Win32 API

Implemented Data Structures

* **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Category management
* **Linked Lists:** Item storage and management
* **Queues:** Customer order processing
* **Stacks:** Undo operation tracking

*All data structures were implemented manually without using STL containers.*



 🧠 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding real-world warehouse workflows
* Applying data structures in practical applications
* Developing GUI applications using Win32 API
* Enhancing teamwork, collaboration, and version control skills
